<p>We women complain all the time that men objectify us but here is the author a woman who encourages other women in a very clear and direct way to use the power of the pussy which is the power of your sexuality to get what you want from men .it is like she is saying Go and objectify yourself ,think of yourself as a "pussy" walking on two legs and that your worth as a woman lies in the power of your "pussy"!</p>
<p>This is one of the most misanthropic, badly written books I ever got my hands on. I found it neither funny nor helpful in any way. I don´t really want a guy I have to treat or educate like a dog, thanks very much. Made me shake my head in disbelief about the "advice" written in a kind of "Ghetto"-style. Not my cup of tea at all. In my opinion it also reduces women to just being a...well...pussy.</p> 
<p>There are a few titles I would definitely recommend to any woman looking to improve her dating situation as well as her life: "Why Men Love Bitches" by Sherry Argov, "He's Just Not That Into You" by Greg Behrendt, and "Act Like A Woman, Think Like A Man" by Steve Harvey are among my top recommendations. Adding a spot among those titles would be "The Power of the Pussy" by Kara King.</p>
<p>First of all, I absolutely love the title! It basically sums up the message that the author wishes to convey to women in her frank and explicit style! Reading this book was like sitting down with one of my girlfriends - the one who doesn't hold back and gives it to you straight! Mrs. King reminds women of the power of their femininity and encourages them to use it to get the love they not only want -but deserve! The language is explicit but the message is clear - stop settling! Life is too short and time is a precious commodity that shouldn't be wasted on a man that doesn't value you</p>
<p>The author includes links to various resources to aid the reader in areas which she might need a bit of extra motivation in such as building up her self-esteem, songs to empower you on your journey to getting the love you deserve and so on</p>
<p>Although I didn't agree with everything the author said, I agreed wholeheartedly with the message: women have been selling themselves far too short and the 'game' won't change until we do by first acknowledging the power our femininity gives us and then fully embracing it. As a single mother of five girls, this would definitely be a title I would encourage my daughters to read before they venture forth into dating. As with any and all self-help or self-improvement titles, take what you want out of it and use it and the rest - put on the shelf or toss away. However, if nothing else - this book will give you a fresh new look at the dating game and definitely provide you with 'food for thought'.</p>
<p>However there were some good advice in this book. The author talks about controling our feelings and actions. A chapter about fixing men was very informative. I liked a chapter about confidence as well.
There are lots of really good information and I think that if the author presented it differently and if she wasn't so concentrated on telling how good it is to use men, this book would be much better.</p>
<P>The author apologizes for using foul language and being harsh before the book starts. Her point is we may not want to play games with men, but women can treat men the way men treat women. In doing so we may have more respect for ourselves and they may have more respect for us. I like this book more than "The Rules" type books. It is more modern and accepting of women's place in society today than some other books of its ilk. It gives more depth and substance to the "He's Just Not that Into You" kind of books, too. I don't agree with everything she says and I get annoyed with some of the philosophy, but I think she has very good points and some harsh realities women might need to face. It is an easy read, yet thought provoking. I doubt there is any harm in telling a woman she does not have to put up with men treating as if she is not important, to keep herself busy by building a life for herself, and possibly finding she can live life without a man. I know the only men I am interested in are the ones that understand I do not need a man taking care of me and I am perfectly capable of doing so myself. They will have to fit themselves into my active social life and existing hobbies and interests... as I expect the same for me in their lives.</p>
<p>This book totally opened my eyes and changed my way of thinking. It tells the truth about real world dating issues. I feel more empowered now, like I can deal with anything a man throws my way. It's such a mental and emotional booster and encouragement that I have been telling all of my friends to take the chance to read it. Most of all, it is blunt and to the point, which is a huge plus when it comes to reading these types of works.</p>
<p>This is one of the worst books I’ve ever encountered. Not one to frequent a “self help book”, this was recommended to me by a well-intentioned friend. I found it completely sexist, misanthropic, and representing a kind reverse misogyny internalized by women. It assumes women have certain attributes and men have others. The author lectures based on these assumptions and does nothing to acknowledge the subtle and beautiful differences of the individual. The author labels women as “sluts and hoes” for normal behavior. Hard pass on this one, ladies.</p>
<p>Why would anyone even read the introduction of this book and want to read it? It was loaned to me by a friend and I thought I would read it for insight into men. What a joke! It is obviously written by a woman who is not a writer, nor does she have a background that would offer much in the way of experience. Silly, ghetto written advice. Save your $$$</p>
<p>A very bad one-sided book with completely one-sided ethics. The author advises women not to get used by men, but turns around and tells them not to hesitate to use men without any compulsions. She says - "don't hesitate to put the losers out to the sidewalk. Don't feel guilty about it - because - what the heck - you are worth it!" She even advocates using men for financial gain</p>
